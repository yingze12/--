## Sensor Data
- [MultiDiffusion: Fusing Diffusion Paths for Controlled Image Generation](MultiDiffusion.md): Finding the optimal representation of the image by minimizing the objective function $\mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{FTD}}$, ensuring all regions coordinate during the denoising process to produce a seamlessly integrated final image.
- [T2I-Adapter: Learning Adapters to Dig out More Controllable Ability for Text-to-Image Diffusion Models](T2I-Adapter.md): The adapter is designed to extract multi-scale conditional features, which are added to the intermediate features of the UNet encoder at each scale, with a multi-adapter control mechanism to adjust the combined strength of different adapters.
- [GLIGEN: Open-Set Grounded Text-to-Image Generation](GLIGEN.md): By fusing the text feature with the Fourier embedding of its bounding box location and then using a multi-layer perceptron to process it, grounding information can be obtained. 
- [SpaText: Spatio-Textual Representation for Controllable Image Generation](SpaText.md):  A text-to-image generation method is proposed, which not only describes the entire scene with a global text prompt but also allows for more precise image generation by using free-form language descriptions for regions of interest.
